					Manager & Scrum
				</header>
				<p>The first time I led a team was in 2007, at Electronic Arts. There I face the challenge of managing the first time
that one of the most sold games in the world was localized into Spanish, Madden NFL. Then, I was
responsible for defining and tracking the development of new internal tools.
Since 2017 to 2020 I have been responsible for the development in Many-Worlds. A very small senior team,
with about 10 projects per year (average). Due to the few developers, I had to develop quite time, but in
between, I defined the guidelines, the global architecture of the projects and the methodology applied,
SCRUM.</p>
<p>For 2 years, I co-directed a team of 15 multi-disciplinar roles for Torofun. A very ambitious social gaming
online platform released for a short period of time. A very tough and changing project where I mentored
developers with several level of experience to build a team. We develop the frontend (Android, iOS and web
games) and the backend (DB, services and realtime games).</p>

<p>I have always been very close to the agile philosophy since the first time I heard of it, about 2006. At that time,
agile wasn’t so widespread as it is now, but I succesfully planted the seed of the methology now used in
Electronic Arts. After that, I have brought that methodology with me to every project I have been involved.
Daily meetings, product backlog, stories... The best fit for each situation. I taught SCRUM to my students of
the u-Tad for 3 years, and I speeched to small companies CEOs about SCRUM. In 2020 I got my SCRUM
Master certification by scrum.org.</p>

					Videogames / VR / AR

				<p>Since My MSc in videogames, this industry has offered me some of the most interesting challenges in my
					career. Very focused in casual small games for mobile platforms, I have successfully published more than 20
					projects. I have had to learn new experimental frameworks (like Hololens and Magicleap). Mainly mobile apps
					(Android and iOS) and WebGL using Unity 3D engine..</p>

					Fullstack
				</header>
				<p>My first jobs (2003-2005) was as a fullstack developer, before it was called fullstack. Frontend (HTML,
					Javascript, CSS) and backend (MySQL, JSP). Since then, I have been a bit far of this part of the development,
					although I have still be involved LAMP developments to provide backend support for some apps. I have
					recovered the interset on this technologies, so I will get my fullstack certificate by GeeksHubs ending 2020
					(NodeJs, MonoDB, React... among others state of the art fullstack development)</p>
